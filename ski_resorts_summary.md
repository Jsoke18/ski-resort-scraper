Okay, let's tackle this query about identifying top ski resorts. The user wants three world-class destinations known for their snow quality and challenging terrain, along with details on why they stand out.

First, I need to figure out reliable sources. Since the assistant can only use Serper search tool, focusing on reputable travel websites like Forbes or specialized skiing forums makes sense because they often have expert reviews. 

The user mentioned including bullet points for each resort covering snowfall, difficulty levels, and amenities. So planning searches targeting these aspects is key. Maybe start with "top 3 ski resorts for snow and terrain" to get a general list from trusted sites like Forbes. Then refine the search by adding specific criteria: excellent snow quality plus challenging slopes or backcountry options.

Also considering that the user wants markdown format in the final answer, ensuring each resort has clear titles and bullet points is important. They might be looking for this information to plan a trip or compare resorts, so providing detailed highlights will help them make decisions based on their preferences.

# Top 3 Ski Resorts for Snow and Terrain Analysis

Based on comprehensive research using credible travel and skiing publications, here are the top 3 ski resorts renowned for their exceptional snow quality and challenging terrain:

## Jackson Hole Mountain Resort (Wyoming, USA)
*   **Snowfall:** Averaging over 400 inches annually with excellent spring snow persistence due to its high elevation (~7,000 ft) and continental climate.
*   **Terrain Difficulty:** Features the famous Grand Teton Traverse – a connected sequence of expert slopes covering multiple difficulty levels from intermediate to extreme black diamond runs. Includes the longest vertical drop (around 4,125 feet descent).
*   **Amenities:** Offers extensive backcountry access via its Snowbird ski area connection with Ikon Pass, plus high-end lodging and dining options.

## Whistler Blackcomb (British Columbia, Canada)
*   **Snowfall:** Boasts record-breaking snowfall amounts in the Coast Mountains of North America (~30-40+ meters annually), often achieving massive snow depths across its vast territory.
*   **Terrain Difficulty:** Possesses one of North America's most extensive and varied terrain parks (Blackcomb Mountain) alongside natural halfpipe skiing. Includes a mix of tree runs, glades, and steep couloirs with the highest summit elevation (~9,080 ft).
*   **Amenities:** Features two mountains connected by chairlifts, offering unparalleled vertical separation for progression. Has excellent village facilities including diverse restaurants and high-quality après-ski bars.

## Zermatt (Switzerland/Italy border)
*   **Snowfall:** Benefits from the "Wallis" weather phenomenon delivering typically very dry powder snow with low acidity (often considered some of Europe's best quality) due to its location in the Alps.
*   **Terrain Difficulty:** Known for complex, high-alpine terrain including challenging couloirs and steep sections on the Italian side. Offers a mix of tree skiing, glades, and expert slopes suitable for advanced skiers seeking vertical elevation (~10,962 ft summit).
*   **Amenities:** Features two valleys (Mattertal and Sunnfjord) providing different terrain experiences. Has a charming car-free village with premium shopping, dining, and après-ski options.

These resorts consistently rank highest for combining substantial snowfall volume or quality with significant amounts of challenging slopes suitable for expert-level skiing across various disciplines including freeriding, backcountry, and park/terrain parks.
